## Architectures
Currently I try to support the architectures listed below. Currently I'm only working on the x86_64 Support, but x86, ARM and AArch64 are following. In the following table you can see the status of every supported architecture
| Architecture | Status | CPU Feature Indication | Control Register |
|-|-|-|-|
| x86_64       | ðŸš§ In progress | âœ… Implemented | âœ… Implemented |
| x86          | ðŸ“Œ Planned     | Not implemented | Not implemented |
| ARM          | ðŸ“Œ Planned     | Not implemented | Not implemented |
| ARM64/AArch64 | ðŸ“Œ Planned     | Not implemented | Not implemented |
